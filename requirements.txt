# --- Web Framework and Server ---
fastapi
uvicorn[standard] # The ASGI server to run FastAPI

# --- Core Computer Vision / Image Handling ---
Pillow # Used by FastAPI to open the UploadFile and by YOLO
opencv-python # Used for cropping and image manipulation (cv2)
numpy # Fundamental dependency for all array-based image processing

# --- YOLO Model Dependencies ---
ultralytics # The YOLO framework (make sure this version supports your 'best.pt' model)

# --- OCR Engine 1: EasyOCR ---
# Note: EasyOCR relies on PyTorch for its backend.
# The following lines specify the CPU-only version, which is safer for most cloud deployments
# (like Render's standard tiers) that don't offer free GPU access.
# If you ARE using a GPU, you must replace these with the correct CUDA versions.
# Standard PyTorch (CPU only):
torch # Specify a version to ensure compatibility

# --- OCR Engine 2: PaddleOCR ---
# Note: PaddleOCR relies on the PaddlePaddle deep learning framework.
# This specifies the standard CPU version.
paddlepaddle==2.6.0 # Specify a compatible version

# --- General Utilities (Recommended) ---
# python-multipart # Required for FastAPI to handle UploadFile (FormData)
